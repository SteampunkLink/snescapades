    question: "Pronoun check?",
    answer:
      "My (Chase Keys') pronouns are he/him. Emmy Zero's pronouns are she/her.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's your release schedule?",
    answer:
      "I'm trying to have a new episode up every Thursday, but there's a chance I might miss some. We're a free show, so... *shrugs*",
  },
  {
    question: "Why did SteampunkLink change his name to Chase Keys?",
    answer:
      "I want to produce video projects at some point while remaining anonymous. I realized I was going to have to mask my appearance in a way that didn’t really work with the SteampunkLink name. SteampunkLink was just a name I used at a very specific time and it stuck, but I’ve never been all that into steampunk, nor did I want the pseudonym to be forever linked (ha) to a named video game character. The name now is a reference to a Nintendo character, but not actually the name of any specific character. I feel like I can do more with that.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I contact you?",
    answer:
      "I'll probably get a proper contact form working on this site someday. Until then, DMing me on Instagram is probably the best way to get hold of me as that's where I get the most engagement these days. You can also reach me on the other social media sites I have linked here. As long as they're still up here, you can probably assume that I still check them. Emmy is not on social media, so if you want to contact her, you'll have to do it through me. Sorry.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "You don't swear in your podcasts. What the f*#% is up with that?",
    answer:
      "We aren't really offended by profanity or anything like that. When doing a few test runs of our first episodes, we just didn't tend to swear very much. It felt silly to me to mark the episode as 'explicit' for the sake of one or two f-bombs, so we decided we just wouldn't swear or we'd bleep out the few swears that we had.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "I can't comment on individual episodes and I really want to. What can I do about this?",
    answer:
      "Keeping bots out of sites takes some doing and I don't want to ask folks to create yet another account for some random website that they have to log into. Going forward, episodes will probably have a version on YouTube (the cafe) so that's probably the best place to leave a comment for now. If you follow me on social media, there's a good chance I'll have posts about the episodes there and you can comment on those as well.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why do you feel the need to bring leftist politics into your shows? Isn't this supposed to be a show about video games?",
    answer:
      "There’s a lot of reasons. As a show that’s hosted by two folks who like to talk about retro games and /“the good ole days/”, it’s important that we not pretend that everything was better for everyone back then than they are now. Plus, if we ever manage to build up a significant following online, we want to keep our space free from toxic creeps and talking about this stuff every now and then tends to weed them out early. I understand some folks find it tiresome. Please know I'd love to live in a world where gaming spaces didn't become toxic so often and this didn't feel necessary, but we don't live in that world yet. If you're offended by our politics, then we likely didn't want you as an audience member anyway.",
  },
  {
    question: "I like your show, is there anyway I can support you?",
    answer:
      "We don’t have a Patreon or any sort of monetization and it’s not really something we plan on doing anytime soon. Not that we’d never consider it, but we just want to keep this a fun project for now. The best way to support us at this point is to help us grow by shouting us out on social media or just telling your friends about us. Also, I’m always looking for my next gig. I’m a (mostly) self-taught Javascript/React developer who dabbles in WordPress and a few other things. I made this site myself. I also edit our podcast and (I like to think) I’m a decent singer. So if you know anyone who could use someone with skills like that, let me know.",
