It’s part 2 of Playing with Power for January 1994. We’re getting the this one started with a bang as we discuss… AN INDEX! Thrilling stuff.

But don’t worry, we’ve also 1993 Game of the Year (according to Nintendo Power), some Magic Eye pictures, Batman, more Ninja Turtles, an article all about music on the SNES, and plenty of Dog Action!

Speaking of those Magic Eye pictures, here they are so you can try them out for yourself.

Not that quite a few of them didn’t deserve it.
