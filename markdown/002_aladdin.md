## Synopsis

Oh, why hello there. We've got another episode for you today. We're talking about Robocop vs. Terminator, Total Carnage, and Disney's Aladdin. What do they all have in common? Not really anything. I'm not sure why I asked.

Robocop vs Terminator is the best SNES adaptation of either of those properties up to this point, but that's a low bar. Does that mean it's actually good, or simply not awful?

Total Carnage has nothing to do with Spider-Man villains, but is a pseudo-sequel to Smash TV. And what's this? Did this game cause an actual disagreement between our hosts? Find out who liked it, who didn't, and where it ultimately landed in our ranking.

We wrap things up with Capcom's take on Disney's take on Aladdin. Is it any good? Yes. How good? C'mon, you have to listen to find that out.

All this, a deep dive about Shinji Mikami, and more on this episode of SNEScapades.
