It's a little bit of a mixed bag today as we reach the final proper episode for the games released on the SNES in 1993.

We start with the top-down, Gauntlet-like shooter Soldiers of Fortune (aka Chaos Engine). Not much to say about that one here. There's mutants in it. That's neat.

Is that a Gundam? Yes! But they aren't allowed to call them that, so let's just call them Metal Marines. That's the second game on tap for today.

Finally, we have a JRPG to cap things off. It's Lufia and the Fortress of Doom. Lufia doesn't carry the same weight as a Final Fantasy or Breath of Fire, but does it deserve to be just as loved as those franchises? We'll let you know.
