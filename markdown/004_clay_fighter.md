## Synopsis

Happy new year, everyone. Sorry our release schedule was so spotty last year. We're hoping to make up for it by starting to go weekly again. Expect these episodes to be recorded FAR in advance, so apologies if we make references that are far out of date. Case in point, this was recorded in October of last year. We know we're making these for at least a month out now so they should get less dated moving forward.

So, we're talking about Out to Lunch, Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle, and Clay Fighter in today's episode. Out to Lunch just barely escapes being relegated to the wrap-up for being an odd curio that neither Chase nor Emmy had really ever heard of before digging into the library for this show. But does that mean it's any good? We'll tell ya.

Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle is based on the manga and anime Ranma 1/2. It's kind of amazing that a manga-based game made it to America so early (the first game in the series was turned into the disappointing "Street Combat"). If you want to hear Chase talk about this game more in-depth (back when he was still SteampunkLink), you can check out this episode of ["Play Comics"](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ranma-1-2-hard-battle-with-steampunk-link-snescapades/id1191388610?i=1000485388499).

Finally, we're talking about Clay Fighter, a game that looks really cool and obviously had a lot of work go into it. But does this one reach the hights of say "World Heroes" or does it sink to the depths of "Power Moves". Look, we already know it's no Street Fighter II, right?

All of this and a deep dive into Interplay. Thanks for sticking with us and we hope to bring you more SNEScapades than ever this year!
