Buckle up, because we've got a need to go really fast in various vehicles. Spiky car? Sounds like fun. Space ship that shoots lasers? Sign me up. Cool cop car? Eh... maybe not that one.

We're starting the show talking about Battle Cars which is another Mode 7 racing game where you drive around and try to use weapons to knock the other cars off the road. It's also very Mad Max inspired. Find out if we think this game is off to the races, or if it's just a pile of scrap.

Then we're chatting about Super Chase HQ, a game in which you get in your car and take off after criminals. Yup, you're playing a cop so you know Chase is going to have a few things to say about that. And no, he's not happy that this game has his name in the title.

Finally, we're talking about Super Nova, which is another entry in the Darius series which strangely left the "Darius" part out of the title. Will this game rise to the heights of Darius Twin before it? Listen and find out.

All of this, and a Taito deep dive on today's episode of SNEScapades.
