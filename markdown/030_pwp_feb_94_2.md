We’re back again and we’re finally finishing up our commentary on the February 1994 issue of Nintendo Power.

We start off talking about an interesting device that put Nintendo games in airplanes and maybe inspired the Wii, kinda? Who knows?

Also, quick behind-the-scenes note; the first musical break is from a game called Noughts and Crosses which was a title exclusive to certain Gateway Systems. It’s basically just fancy tic tac toe. There was also a Hangman game and a slide puzzle called Postcard Puzzle. Noughts and Crosses is the only one we have footage and music of.

We’re also talking about Metroid comics, politicians, X-Men, Simpsons, Startropics 2, and a whole lot more.

So thank granny, sit down, and listen to this podcast. You have been watching too much tv already.
