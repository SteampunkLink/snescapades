It's time for another Playing with Power episode where we crack open the very last Nintendo Power issue for the year 1993. Aladdin is on the cover, so that's pretty cool. You can follow along with us by checking out the [Internet Archive's copy of the issue](https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20055%20%28December%201993%29/mode/2up).

In this episode, we tackle all the hard-hitting questions: What is the political leader of Ireland called? Why don't my special moves work in Street Fighter II? Did the idea for the Wii Remote start with an obscure Nintendo system for planes and hotels? What does Bad Mr. Frosty want? Which SNES games were the most awkward? Will the Star Fox comic ever move past the fact that Fox's new girlfriend looks like his mom? Does Chase understand the difference between Jay Leno and David Letterman?

Answers to all of these questions and more on this (kinda long) episode of SNEScapades Playing with Power. We hope you enjoy.
