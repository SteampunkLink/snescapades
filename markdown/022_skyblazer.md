The hits keep on coming as we venture further into January 1994. But first, we gotta talk a little bit about British Candy.

On this week’s episode of SNEScapdes, we’re talking about quirky British platformer Zool: Ninja of the Nth Dimension. It’s about a ninja, it had Chupa Chup branding in the UK, that’s pretty much all you need to know.

We’re also talking about Lester the Unlikely. This is a game with a bit of a reputation. Will Chase and Emmy find this one to be as bad as that reputation would suggest or is there anything redeeming about it?

And finally, we’re talking about Skyblazer. This is a game that was not on Chase’s or Emmy’s radars before, but they both really loved it. Did you know about this one from back in the day?

All of this and a deep(ish) dive on Gremlin Graphics on today’s SNEScapades.
