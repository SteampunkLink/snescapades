## Synopsis

Hey everyone. Welcome back! It's time for the second part of Playing with Power for September 1991's issue of Nintendo Power. We talked about a lot of Mario World last week. This week we're talking about a whole lot of stuff. We've got Game Boy stuff (like Final Fantasy Adventure), NES stuff (like Kick Master), and more SNES stuff (like Castlevania.)

There is so much stuff. Emmy talks about her encounter with American Gladiators, Chase ponders if anyone from The Simpsons actually signed off on Bart Simpson's "interview", and there's even some POGs in there. Er... sorry, they're "milk caps". POGs is a registered trademark. You won't wanna miss all this, come listen and feel free to follow along! You can read the magazine here (we start on the Smash TV feature). Don't forget, you can follow along with the [Internet Archive's copy of the issue here!](https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20028%20%28September%201991%29/)
