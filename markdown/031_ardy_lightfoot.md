Hey everyone! We're back and we're talking about some games that came out in February of 1994 on the SNES.

Things aren't amazing this month, gonna put that out there right now. After playing Bugs Bunny's Rabbit Rampage, Chase and Emmy are even more shocked that Nintendo Power snubbed SkyBlazer for the February 94 Nintendo Power cover in favor of this game.

After playing Flashback, Emmy is wondering if its spiritual predecessor, Out of this World, was actually as good as she remembers or if this is really just that big of a leap down in quality.

The one bright spot of the bunch is Ardy Lightfoot. It's not the most amazing game, but it has a lot of charm. Will it be enough to keep it out of the more mediocre ranks? Listen and find out!
