## Synopsis

Here we go again! It's time to discuss another issue of Nintendo Power. If you want to follow along, you can do that by checking out the [Internet Archive's copy of the issue here!](https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20028%20%28September%201991%29/)

And we have a LOT to talk about in this issue. This is the issue that properly introduced its readers to Super Mario World. That alone makes this a very special issue for Chase, but it's even more special because for him because his had a fun marketing gimmick on the cover. To get readers to renew their subscriptions, NP would occasionally wrap the magazine in an additional cover. Here's what it looked like when Chase got it back in 1991.

![A message on a white page written in a variety of wacky fonts and colors that reads "This secret message is for the eyes of blank only." The name has been blanked out with a black box to protect Chase's identity. There is a blank box outlined in black where the message would have been read.](/images/other/NP_Cover_Renew.jpg)

But Emmy and Chase aren't only going to be talking about Super Mario World (though that is a pretty big chunk of what they'll be talking about) but there's also Star Wars, Power Animals, REM, another one of these freaking Nester Comics, a check in with Newsie, and more. There's so much stuff to talk about, that we're just going to break this up into two episodes. So please be sure to check back next week for the conclusion of this episode.
