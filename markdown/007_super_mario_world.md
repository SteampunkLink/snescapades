## Synopsis

Here we are, back where we started. We're talking about two of the most prominent launch titles for the Super NES.

First up is F-Zero, which was an amazing showcase of what the SNES's Mode 7 graphics were capable of. We placed it in the A tier when we first talked about it a few year back. Will we be a charitable to this impressive game, or will its lack of features cause it to slip a little in the rankings?

And finally, we gush a little bit more about Super Mario World. Look, you don't need me to leave you in suspense, we love this game and it's position at the top of the list is really not in any danger (that is, if we were still doing individual numerical rankings).

Also, we do a deep dive into the founding family of Nintendo, the Yamauchis. Happy listening!
