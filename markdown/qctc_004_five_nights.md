## Synopsis

It's Thanksgiving weekend and you know what that means? It's time for our yearly (usually yearly) movie review podcast. We decided to watch Five Nights at Freddy's in the hope that we could spare any of you having to watch this boring, nothing-burger of a movie. So consider this your warning because we're spoiling everything about this movie.
Are you spending the weekend with some relatives that are, let's say, not politically aligned with you? Well, this movie might give you something we can all hate together.

Will our wooden protagonist manage to keep his little sister out of his evil aunt's clutches? Will the antagonist end up being the guy played by the most recognizable actor in the movie? Who was that girl at the food court? Wait, how do these animatronics work? How does this compare to Willy's Wonderworld? We'll (try to) answer all these questions and more.
