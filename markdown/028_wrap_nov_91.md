We've come to the end of November 1991 again and we're looking at the remainders. They're... not much to write home about. We have a lot of sports, which we don't really do much of any more (though one of them, we still enjoyed.) We're talking about Bill Laimbeer's Combat Basketball, John Madden Football, Super Tennis, and True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club.

There's also RPM Racing and Paperboy 2. Like I said, not much to talk about this week.
