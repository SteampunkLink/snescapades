It’s perhaps never been more dire than it is today folks. January 1994 was a pretty light month to kick off what will end up being the most packed year of the SNES’s lifespan. And while we had two absolute bangers to talk about this month, we’ve reached the end and it’s time to talk about everything else that released, and sadly, it’s a lot of sports titles, cops, military, and a game that even Nintendo Power suggested was a poor investment considering how cheap it would be to buy a deck of playing cards.

We don’t have a lot of nice things to say about this group of games (many of which are brought to you by Extreme Entertainment Group), so this one’s a little on the short side.

We’re discussing Riddick Bowe Boxing, Brett Hull Hockey, Super Battletank 2, Super Solitaire, Lethal Enforcers (barf), and Choplifter III. Um… yeah. That’s it. Sorry.
