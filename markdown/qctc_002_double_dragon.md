## Synopsis

It's been a rough year and the salt in the wound that is 2020 is that most of us have to spend Thanksgiving alone or at least can't gather with our extended families like we have in the past. So if you're doing the responsible thing and staying home, maybe this podcast can help you pass the time.

This year for our Quick, Change the Channel special, we're talking about 1994's Double Dragon. We went into this one expecting a fun cheese fest like the Street Fighter movie, but sadly this was a much less-fun cheese fest. Bad dialogue, mostly unimpressive fight scenes, and uninspired sets (with the exception of the slime factory) topped off with unintentional (we hope) bad politics make this a mess that even Alyssa Milano's cute pixie cut couldn't save.

So don't watch this movie, but do enjoy our fun(?) breakdown as we clumsily try to remember what happened in this thing since we both refused to watch it more than once.

Stay safe out there!
