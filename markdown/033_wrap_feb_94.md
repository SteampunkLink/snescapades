We were going to do another episode here, but the games ended up being so bad that we just put them into the wrap and decided to put February 1994 out of its misery.

Today, we are going to have to briefly talk about a lot of sports games and a very bad arcade port-turned Super Scope game. We also have the (quite aptly named in Emmyâ€™s case) Turn and Burn: No Fly Zone, X-Kaliber 2097, and Super Troll Islands.

The games are bad, but luckily Chase and Emmy find ways to keep the conversation fun by talking about more interesting things, like Mr. Blobby and The New Grolier CD-ROM encyclopedia.
