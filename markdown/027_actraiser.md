Hey everyone! We're revisiting two games today. One we really liked the first time we reviewed it, and another that we didn't like much at all from the outset, then maybe, kinda softened on it a bit? It's complicated.

Actraiser is one of the few games Chase finished for the first time while playing it for the show. Do he and Emmy still like it as much as they once did? And where will they ultimately land on Super Ghouls N Ghosts? Listen and find out.
