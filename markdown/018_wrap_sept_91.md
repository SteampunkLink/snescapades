We have come to the end of September 1991 once again. Chase and Emmy played these games so long ago, how have they held up? For the most part, not great.

In this episode, we talk about Hal’s Hole-in-One, Super Bases Loaded (featuring Ryne Sandburg… kinda), The Chessmaster, HyperZone, Populous, Final Fight, and a special guest appearance by Ultraman: Towards the Future.

A lot of these games are somewhat unique on the system and some of them take some pretty big swings, but most of them fall flat. How will that effect their placement in the SNES rankings?
