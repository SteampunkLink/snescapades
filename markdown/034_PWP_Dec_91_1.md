Another month, another two-part episode of Playing with Power. As we look at the December 1991 issue of NP, we couldn’t help but be kinda impressed with the various Nintendo-related works that some readers had made in their spare time.

We also get a look at Batman: Return of the Joker, which is an interesting game since it’s a sequel to the first NES Batman video game which was based on the movie despite not being based on the sequel to the movie.

Of course there’s a Nester comic, and this one is alright. There’s the usual suspects of Classified Information, Counselor’s Corner, and a very cool poster feature the Ninja Turtles. There’s also features about Actraiser for the SNES and The Addams Family for the NES.

There’s also an NES game based on Tiny Toons. Since that cartoon featured a boy and a girl protagonist, this is a great opportunity for NES gamers to get a female playable character… oh wait… no… Babs spends the game kidnapped. \*sigh\*
