Welcome, one and all, to the very first edition of The Wrap. This is an episode of SNEScapades where we look at all of the leftover games from a particular month that we didn’t feel was worth one-third of an entire featured episode.

Why did we decide to start doing this? Well the first two games on the docket have a lot to do with that. Actraiser 2 is the game that nearly broke Chase and Biometal was so dull that Emmy questioned whether she could continue talking more than a few minutes about every single game on the system. So congratulations Actraiser 2 and Biometal for being so awful and bland respectively that we changed the entire format of our show.

We also discuss (briefly) Championship Pool, International Tennis Tour, Lamborghini American Challenge, NHL Stanley Cup, Steel Talons, Super Battleship, Super Putty, Super Tecmo Bowl, Terminator 2: Judgement Day, Time Slip, Tony Meola’s Sidekick Soccer, and We’re Back: A Dinosaur’s Story.

Whew, that’s a lot of games, and we still managed to keep this episode a pretty typical length. We hope you enjoy this rapid-fire format for getting through the less-interesting stuff.
