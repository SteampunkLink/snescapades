Have you ever imagined what it would be like to have Stopless Power?\*

Well imagine no more, cuz we're diving into the pages of yet another issue of Nintendo Power to tell you what all that power felt like back in the early 90s. We've got a lot to discuss here, like Final Fantasy II (and the somewhat dubious art NP made for it), Tom and Jerry (and they're amazing 90s garb), Nester's more sociopathic tenancies, The Flintstones, Freddy Krueger, Faceball, and more. So come join us, won't you?

\*Of course you haven't. "Stopless" isn't a word. I know it isn't because my note app is putting red squiggles under it.

PS. I promised some scans from this one, but my scanner is not actually working, sorry about that.
