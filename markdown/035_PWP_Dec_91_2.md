Welcome back to part two of the December 91 Playing with Power episode and it seems this is an issue featuring many returns. Last time we talked about the Return of the Joker, this time we’re talking about Return of Samus, aka Metroid II for Game Boy which features some really gross art (which we mean as a compliment.)

Later we talk about Adventure Island for Game Boy which also has some gross art (which we DON’T mean as a compliment).

There’s also a Ninja Gaiden game for Game Boy. And if that wasn’t enough Game Boy for you, we also get to see some reader created custom Game Boy designs. Some of these are REALLY cool and make us wish they had been real. There’s also a few SNES previews for Pilotwings and Populous. There’s lots to talk about, including that gal from Blossom, squishy monsters, SNES arcade software. We hope you enjoy!
