## Synopsis

It's our pilot episode of Quick, Change the Channel, a podcast talking about movie and tv adaptations of video games. We decided that the first movie we talk about should be the one we're took the podcast's name from. So, we're breaking down 1994's Street Fighter starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia.

Join us for this over two hour breakdown as we comb through every crumb of camp this movie has to offer. We'll discuss how well (and mostly how poorly) this movie adapted the characters from the game, all of Bison's plots, the surprising amount of white extras in this movie taking place entirely in southeast Asia, and more!
