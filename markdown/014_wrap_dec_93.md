## Synopsis

We've reached the end of another month. And that means it's time to wrap things up with another edition of The Wrap. But before we get to that, we just want to let you all know that we'd love to have folks come on our show to discuss thier favorite SNES games. If you're a fellow content creator, feel free to reach out on Instagram, Youtube, or even Bluesky. You get to pick three SNES games to form the episode around and chat with us around them. If you're nice, we might even let you help us rank them!

Alright, with all of that out of the way. It's time to talk about what we're doing on December 1993's edition of The Wrap. We've got sports games, Koei strategy games, and a Super Scope game. But there's also games that we're going to talk about.

In sports, we've got ABC Monday Night Football, Dig & Spike Volleyball, and World Soccer '94. There's also F1 Pole Position and Side Pocket in games that are kinda sports. Somehow three freaking Koei games came out in the same month, Nobunaga's Ambition, Romance of the Three Kingdom's III, and Genghis Khan II. The Super Scope game is Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge, which we don't have a way to play right now, but have it on pretty good authority that it's the best of the Super Scope games.

And, of course, there's the licensed stuff. We've got Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper, Barbie Super Model, Dennis the Menace, and Mario's Time Machine. We're going to talk about them all and rank them. Will there be any surprises? I'm not gonna say. You'll have to listen to find out.
