## Synopsis

Hey folks. We're gonna tell you about a trio of 2D platform games on today's show. We're not going to lie to you. Things start out a little bit dire on today's episode. The first two games feature franchises that didn't last very long.

Dr. Franken is a game that answers the question "What if a bunch of boring people tried to make Frankenstein's monster a cool dude?" You get a pretty bland video game. Jim Power: Lost Dimension in 3D seems to ask the question "Can we make gamers motion sick with a 2D game?" Both of these games are technically playable, but will that be enough to save either of them from the "F" tier?

Our last game for today is Inspector Gadget, which is based on the popular 80s/90s cartoon. The titular Inspector is mostly known for being a witless buffoon on that show, but could he be the hero we need to come back from this dire episode? Or is "best game of the episode" a very relative term this week?
