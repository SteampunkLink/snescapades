Things weren’t going swimmingly last time as far as February 1994 goes for the SNES. Sadly, this week isn’t going to be much better.

We have to talk about a very strange “edutainment” game called Mickey’s Ultimate Challenge. While this is a game for young children, will Emmy or Chase find any merit in it as a teaching tool? Or will they conclude that giving your little ones this game is more likely to end in tantrums?

Alfred Chicken is another game from the UK. Can its gameplay make up for its strange lack of any sense of place?

Those first two games weren’t amazing, but just like last week, there is one palette cleanser. This time it comes in the form of the fun arcade port Ninjawarriors. Hope you enjoy listening more than they did playing most of these. And remember our important tip: DON’T put slide puzzles in your video game. Please.
