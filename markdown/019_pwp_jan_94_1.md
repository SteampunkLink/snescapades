Hey everyone! It’s a new Playing With Power episode. This one is very special, not just because we’re finally in 1994, not just because Megaman X is on the cover, but because this is a big ol’ bonus issue. Which means Chase and Emmy have a LOT to talk about.

Megaman X is a huge game for the duo and is going to give them plenty to talk about by itself. But the duo also find time to discuss some other game features that they haven’t gotten to play yet, let Flashback and Claymates. Both of these games are built on the legacies of other games made by their respective studios. Only time will tell if either of them lived up to their spiritual predecessors.

We got Soldiers of Fortune, Bugs Bunny, Ninja Turtles, Classified Information, solitaire, a really cute Mario & Wario comic, and some forbidden knowledge in the form of games that never made it over to America.
