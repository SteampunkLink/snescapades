We decided that there were four games worth talking about from November of 1991, so we've broken them down into two pairs. Today we're talking about Darius Twin and Final Fantasy II.

Darius Twin is a pretty solid shooter that lets you play co-op. We really liked it the first time around. Are we going to be as generous to it this time?

Okay, but seriously, we're mostly here to talk about Final Fantasy II, right? Known as Final Fantasy IV today, this is the Final Fantasy game with Cid in it. Oh, and Cecil, and Kain, and Rydia, and all those other folks. We like this one a whole lot and will break down a lot of elements we think are great (and a few that are less great) on today's episode of SNEScapades.
