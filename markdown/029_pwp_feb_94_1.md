Hey everyone! Sorry we've been gone for so long. It's been a hot summer and Chase doesn't have AC in his office. Also, stuff just kept happening so we decided to take a bit of a hiatus over the summer. We should be back to getting things out weekly for the foreseeable future (hopefully). In any case, the next few episodes were recorded well before the hiatus.

We've reached a new month in the chronology, and that means it's another episode of Playing with Power where we talk about that month's issue of Nintendo Power. It's February of 1994 which means a quick check-in with Newsie before we dive in. Bugs Bunny's on the cover, but we think NP dropped the ball by not giving it to SkyBlazer.

In this episode, we talk about cool things sent in by NP readers of the day. There's also Looney Tunes, SkyBlazer, Inspector Gadget, Sports, and more. So much more that we ended up splitting this one into two parts, and we even leave it on a bit of a cliff-hanger.

If you want to follow along (and spoil that cliff-hanger for the next episode) you can read this issue [on the Internet Archive.]("https://archive.org/details/NintendoPower1988-2004/Nintendo%20Power%20Issue%20057%20%28February%201994%29/mode/2up")
