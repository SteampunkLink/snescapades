Hey everyone. Welcome to another episode of SNEScapades. We’re talking shooters today. Oh, and I guess Drakkhen’s here too.

The early days of the SNES had plenty of shm’ups to play. Chase and Emmy were a little less kind to Gradius III than they were the first time they encountered it due to all of its slowdown. Today they’re talking about Super R-Type, which is a similar kind of shooter with classic arcade roots. Will it drop in the ranks like its contemporary or will it stay its original charted course? Hell, will they actually like it more? Who’s to say? Well, they are, but you have to listen to the episode to find out.

Drakkhen is a strange game in the SNES library. It was rewarded for its uniqueness the first time around but Chase and Emmy’s opinion on the game sullied a bit over time. Find out where this strange RPG ultimately ends up.

And finally, we’ve got a re-review of UN Squadron, a Capcom shooter that Emmy and Chase have thought highly of in the past. Listen to find out if they still hold it in such high regard on this episode of SNEScapades!
