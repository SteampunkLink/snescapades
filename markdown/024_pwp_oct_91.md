It's time for us to discuss another issue of Nintendo Power. A lot of these Playing with Power episodes have been broken up into two parts lately, but with this one... well... there just isn't as much to talk about. There's still stuff to talk about, but not a ton of behind-the-scenes features that we had been getting is past issues.

So what do we have? Well, we have kids talking about their gaming parents, Star Trek in NES form, Star Wars in Nester comic form, hot tips for Super Mario World (and Zombie Nation?), a very cool feature on classic Metroid, Game Boy stuff, and some SNES Q & A (basically explaining to kids why Santa might not have been bringing them a SNES that year). Oh, and there are SNES previews so kids could be teased by all the games they probably weren't going to get yet.

Of course, what kid's magazine could leave out an interview with a beloved celebrity. Who is the subject of this profile? Why it's Murphy Brown's Joe Regalbuto, of course! Oh how we 90s kids used to talk about the wacky antics of Joe Regalbuto.

All this and more in this episode of SNEScapades Playing with Power.
